            <h3> 肥後守 - higonokami</h3>
            <p class="text-common">A higonokami (肥後守) is a folding pocket knife originating in Miki, Hyōgo Prefecture. The handle of the Higonokami is made of a folded sheet of metal and the handle is stamped with the name of the maker of the knife. Higo no kami translates to ‘lord of the Higo region’, an old province on the island of Kyūshū, today's Kumamoto Prefecture. Kami was used as an honorable title for samurai of a very high rank. The knife first appeared in 1896 as a result of smiths struggling with the lowering demand for swords with the decline of the samurai under the reforms made in the late 19th century.

            <h3>鹿苑寺 - deer garden temple</h3>
            <p class="text-common">Better known as kinkaku ji (金閣寺, temple of the golden pavilion), Rokuon ji is a zen buddhist temple in Kyoto. The building is a former villa called kitayama dai and dates back in the fourteenth century. Unfortunately,  the original structure completely burned down in 1950. The reconstruction is said to be a copy close to the original, although some doubt such an extensive gold-leaf coating was used on the original structure. The Muromachi period is known for its heavily visual excesses, more as the gold employed was intended to purify any pollution or negative thoughts and feelings towards death.</p>

            <h3>autumn in Japan</h3>
            <p class="text-common"> When the leaves of the Japanese Ginkgo tree turn yellow, autumn is coming. Did you know Ginkgo trees are often located near a temple or Shinto shrine? Besides worshipping the tree and eating its fruit, there is one more special reason: Ginkgo leaves won’t burn easily, so they protect the structure against fire. </p>

            <h3>awa ai!</h3>
            <p class="text-common">I fell in love with Japanse indigo when I came across some interesting Instagram accounts (I’ll post some in my Stories). The 600-year-old Japanese indigo dyeing tradition starts with fermented and preserved indigo leaves: sukumo. The dye is produced in the Awa district of Tokushima prefecture, and therefore better known as ‘Awa ai’. Awa is referring to the old name for the region, and ai translates to indigo-dyed blue (ai also means love in Japanese - that cannot be a coincidence).</p>
